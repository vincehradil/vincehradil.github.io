What do you think would happen if we could reduce friction even more?

1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[It would go even farther?] It would go even farther!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I like that answer! Sounds very logical! 

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we push that to its logical conclusion, let's say we reduced friction even more after that, what happens?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
[I guess if you could eventually get friction to zero the object would never stop.]

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's quite a statement!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
[It makes me think of an episode of Magic School Bus I saw when I was a kid.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They shrunk down and that's what they talked about. If there was no friction (I think they were in an ice rink), 

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
they said if there was no friction you could never stand still because you'd always be moving.]

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Beautiful! So, believe it or not we can actually do that experiment. 

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Almost! We can make friction go to almost zero. I've got a special item to help us with that. 

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have some dry ice. The beauty of dry ice (it's solid carbon dioxide) is that where regular ice melts into a liquid,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
dry ice turns directly into a gas. We call that sublimation. So it doesn't make anything wet. 

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
For our purposes, what's nice (see... that's the gas)

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
for our purposes when I put it on a smooth surface and rub it around to make the bottom flat

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
what'll happen is that it will float on a little cushion of gas.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So there won't be any rubbing between the dry ice and the floor, effectively removing friction. 

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's not perfect, but it's very, very close. 

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So, why don't you get behind me.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going to shove this the same way I was shoving the piece of wood and let's see how far it goes. 

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
[Oh my gosh!] I mean, look at it! It's cruising! [Wow!]
