00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Now that you've made a prediction for what the speed vs. time graph should look like,

1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
let's go ahead and measure the speed of the sliding block as a function of time. 

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You do this by performing a video analysis of the sliding block movie. 

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The idea is simple. You click on the center of the block in each frame of the movie.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The computer then calculates the speed by taking the distance travelled by the block between each set of frames

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and dividing by the time. 

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You should see the speed vs. time graph being constructed as you click on the frames in the movie.
