We've just seen that when friction is acting, the block slows down and comes to rest.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
One useful way of depicting this is to plot the speed of the block as a function of time.

00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,000
Here are some sample speed versus time graphs.

We'd like you to choose the one that you think best represents the motion of the sliding block.
