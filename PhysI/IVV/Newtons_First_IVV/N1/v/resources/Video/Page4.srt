00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Notice that the speed decreases to zero in a steady, straight line manner. 

1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We call this a linear relationship. 

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The amount of time it takes the block to come to rest depends on the slope of this line. 

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A steep slope represents a large frictional force where the object comes to rest very quickly. 

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A shallower slope represent a smaller frictional force where the block travels farther before coming to rest.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A horizontal line represents an object that doesn't slow down at all.
