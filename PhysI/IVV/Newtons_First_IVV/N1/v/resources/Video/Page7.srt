You can see, it really doesn't slow down at all.

1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
OK, come on back over here. I'll get this our of our way.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's do a little wrap up. So, we were able to effectively reduce friction to essentially zero, and what happened?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
[It never stopped.] [Well, it did stop but we stopped it.] We stopped it!

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Do you think we could run this experiment in a way that if no one was there it would really go forever?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
[I guess if you reduced friction all the way to zero.]

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And removed the brick wall... [And removed the brick wall...] And removed the house next door.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
[So you would have to have infinite space as well.]

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's really difficult to perform the ideal experiment and that's one of the things that makes motion a little difficult to understand.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is an example of what is called Newton's First Law of Motion.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He said, back in 1687, that if an object is moving, if it's in motion, it will continue to move 

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
in a straight line with a constant speed forever, unless acted upon by another force. In principle, that is true.  

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Scientists believe it is true. In practice you can never actually do that experiment. You can only think of the idealization of that experiment.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So that's one of the things that makes it a little difficult.
