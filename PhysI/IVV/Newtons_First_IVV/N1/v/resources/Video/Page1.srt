[sound effects]

1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
We are here in the beautiful school of law building to do some physics experiments 

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If I take some object, maybe a chair, and I give it a shove, and let it go, what do you think will happen? 

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
[It'll move a few feet and then stop.]  [Or fall over.]

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're going to try that experiment right here. Instead of a chair we'll use a piece of wood. 

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to give it a pretty good shove.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
1, 2, 3...

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
OK, come on back and tell me what you saw.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
[Well, it moved a couple inches and then stopped.] [It didn't move much.]

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Why do you think it didn't move much?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
[Friction would be my guess.]
